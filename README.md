griminal-tumblr-theme
=====================

I've made a theme for Tumblr.

It is minimal, it is grim, but it allows you to make it colorful and gay (I don't mean the sexual orientation here). It uses Cuprum web font by default and provides few features I missed in many standard themes, as share buttons, Google Analytics script, builtin Google+ authorship, Facebook Insights tags, Disqus comments, etc. Of course, you may always leave it disactivated.

Google+ Authorship - click this option to activate. Then you would need to fill the name to be displayed in 'Google Author Name' and, of course, link to your G+ profile in 'Google Author Link'. So you might put your Google+ page link into 'Google Page' (orly?).

Google Analytics ID - just paste your GA ID here to allow tracking.

Facebook Insights - just fill your Facebook ID to be able to track your blog on Fb. I've no idea how to use the App ID here, but if you know, you can.

AddThis ID - just fill your ID here to allow tracking your blog posts shares. But you may first want to activate Share buttons option.

Disqus Shortname - fill with your disqus shortname to allow Disqus comments system on your blog. You will find the details on Disqus site: http://disqus.com

That's all for now. I'm sure there's many to improve in the theme's HTML structure and CSS.
